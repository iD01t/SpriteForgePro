# Sprite Forge Ultimate v3.0.0

Welcome to **Sprite Forge Ultimate**, a premium, production-ready, cross-platform desktop application for professional sprite and texture creation. It is especially powerful for developers in the Doom modding community.

This application is the result of merging the best features of `Sprite Forge Pro` and `Sprite Forge Enhanced` into a single, cohesive, and powerful tool.

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6 Pillow numpy opencv-python
    ```

2.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python sprite_forge_ultimate.py
    ```

3.  **Open an Image**: Go to `File > Open...` or use the shortcut `Ctrl+O`.

4.  **Apply Effects**: Use the plugins in the side panel to modify your image.

5.  **Export**: Save your work in your desired format.

## ü§ñ Batch Processing (CLI)

Automate your image processing tasks using the headless mode.

**Syntax:**
`python sprite_forge_ultimate.py --headless --input <path> --output <path> --apply <Operation> [params...]`

**Examples:**

- **Pixelate a single file:**
  ```bash
  python sprite_forge_ultimate.py --headless --input assets/player.png --output processed/player_pixel.png --apply Pixelate factor=8
  ```

- **Process an entire folder and apply multiple effects:**
  ```bash
  python sprite_forge_ultimate.py --headless --input assets/monsters/ --output processed/monsters/ --apply "Doom Palette" dither=true --apply Enhance brightness=1.1 contrast=1.05
  ```

## üîå Plugin Authoring

You can easily create your own plugins.

### JSON Plugins

For simple `ImageProcessor` operations, create a `.json` file in the `plugins/` directory.

**`plugins/example_emboss_plugin.json`**
```json
{
  "name": "Emboss",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Applies a simple emboss effect.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "category": "Effects",
  "operation": "emboss",
  "parameters": {}
}
```
*(Note: The "emboss" operation would need to be added to `ImageProcessor` for this specific example to work).*

### Python Plugins

For more complex logic, create a `.py` file. (Full Python plugin support to be fleshed out).
